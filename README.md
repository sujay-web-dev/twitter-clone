Twitter-clone-App-Made-from-Reactjs-with-Firebase-Backend



This project is built with React.js as front end framework and Firebase as a backend.
In this project I have used UseEffect, UseState React Hooks , &
Used Component Based Structure for build most UI,

This app has a real time feature of Posting new message as a tweet with images , and also used react-twitter-embed for extracting Real Tweets from Twitter.
